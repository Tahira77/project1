# House Price Prediction

This Python code is for predicting house prices using a simple Linear Regression model. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. You can use this code as a starting point for your own house price prediction project.

## Dependencies

Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn

# Usage
Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

Place your dataset file (in CSV format) in the same directory as this script and replace 'data.csv' in the code with the filename of your dataset.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the code is located.

Run the code:
python house_price_prediction.py

The code will load your dataset, preprocess the data, train a Linear Regression model, and evaluate its performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) Score.

You can also use the trained model to make predictions for a new house by replacing [...] in the code with the feature values of the new house and running the script again.
